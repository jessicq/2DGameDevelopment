Project description:
 - Swinub and his/her/its friends are enjoying a happy day and then a portal appears and sucks in swinub. Swinub needs to find a way to get back home, but the Prime Evil's forces
   stand in the way. Will he/she/it get back home safely?

The easiest part of this project:
 1. Implementing the sound
 2. Transferring gifs into frames for the sprites.
 3. Observer Pattern
 4. Singleton Pattern

Problems that I had in completing this project:
 1. Collision Detection - player gets into a collision with a non-existing sprite
 2. Weird memory leaks/deleting twice errors, figured out that the issue was 'make clean'
